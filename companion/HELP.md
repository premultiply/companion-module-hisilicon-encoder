New Orange Technology H.265/H.264 Video Encoder

This module supports H.264(AVC)/H.265(HEVC) IP streaming video encoders based on SoCs and their SDK offered by HiSilicon (Huawei) and Ambarella sold by many brands all over the word. It seems like the base hardware design and control application is developed by New Orange Technology and gets further branded and customized by other vendors or resellers.

This includes brands and vendors like

- URayTech
- J-Tech Digital
- Pro Video Instruments
- Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI)
- Oupree
- MINE Technology
- Blankom
- ISEEVY
- Orivision
- WorldKast
- Digicast
- DIVAR
- U.T.E. Electronic
- ...

The devices all look very similar and use at least three different hardware generations. They are available as standalone or rackmount devices with HDMI or SDI inputs.
The integrated Web UI may be heavily customized and restyled but the core HTTP API and functionallity is always the same. The Firmware (packaged as "up.rar") may be swappable on the same hardware generation between different vendors.

SoCs used:

- Gen1: Hi3516AV100 (HiSilicon)
- Gen2: Hi3520DV400 (HiSilicon)
- Gen3: S6L55M (Ambarella)
